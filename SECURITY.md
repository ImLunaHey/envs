# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest commit from the "main" branch is currently supported with security updates. Support for specific versions may be added in the future.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Users should report any issues they believe may be security vulnerabilities, as all reports will be considered. To report a vulnerability, users can either open an issue on GitHub or send you a direct message on Discord (ImLunaHey#2485).
If users believe a vulnerability is severe, they may choose to stop using this software.

## Protecting Yourself
While waiting for a security update, users should follow best practices for protecting themselves.
